# RBAC for Prometheus Operator CRDs

## Aggregated ClusterRoles

It can be useful to aggregate permissions on the Prometheus Operator CustomResourceDefinitions to the default user-facing roles, like `view`, `edit` and `admin`.

This can be achieved using ClusterRole aggregation. This lets admins include rules for custom resources, such as those served by CustomResourceDefinitions or Aggregated API servers, on the default roles.

> Note: ClusterRole aggregation is available starting Kubernetes 1.9. 

## Example

In order to aggregate _read_ (resp. _edit_) permissions for the Prometheus Operator CustomResourceDefinitions to the `view` (resp. `edit` / `admin`) role(s), a cluster admin can create the `ClusterRole`s below.

This grants:
- Users with `view` role permissions to view the Prometheus Operator CRDs within their namespaces,
- Users with `edit` and `admin` roles permissions to create, edit and delete Prometheus Operator CRDs within their namespaces.
