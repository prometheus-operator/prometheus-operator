description: Guide to use ScrapeConfig to scrape targets external to the Kubernetes cluster
---

Starting with prometheus-operator v0.65.x, one can use the `ScrapeConfig` CRD to scrape targets external to the
Kubernetes cluster or create scrape configurations that are not possible with the higher level
`ServiceMonitor`/`Probe`/`PodMonitor` resources.

# Prerequisites
* `prometheus-operator` `>v0.65.1`
* `ScrapeConfig` CRD installed in the cluster. Make sure to (re)start the operator after the CRD has been created/updated.

# Configure Prometheus or PrometheusAgent to select ScrapeConfigs

Both the Prometheus and PrometheusAgent CRD have a `scrapeConfigSelector` field. This field needs to be set to a list of
labels to match `ScrapeConfigs`:

```yaml
spec:
  scrapeConfigSelector:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
```

With this example, all `ScrapeConfig` having the `prometheus` label set to `system-monitoring-prometheus` will be used
to generate scrape configurations.

# Use ScrapeConfig to scrape an external target

`ScrapeConfig` currently supports a limited set of service discoveries:
* `static_config`
* `file_sd`
* `http_sd`
* `kubernetes_sd`
* `consul_sd`

The following examples are basic and don't cover all the supported service discovery mechanisms. The CRD is constantly evolving, adding new features. Check the API documentation to see all the available fields.

If you have an interest in another service discovery mechanism or you see something missing in the implementation, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues).

## `static_config`

For example, to scrape the target located at `http://prometheus.demo.do.prometheus.io:9090`, use the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: coreos.monitoring.com/v1alpha1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: static-config
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
spec:
  staticConfigs:
    - labels:
        job: prometheus
      targets:
        - prometheus.demo.do.prometheus.io:9090
```

## `file_sd`

To use `file_sd`, a file has to be mounted in the Prometheus or PrometheusAgent pods. The following configmap is a service discovery file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: scrape-file-sd-targets
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
data:
  targets.yaml: |
    - labels:
        job: node-demo
      targets:
      - node.demo.do.prometheus.io:9100
    - labels:
        job: prometheus
      targets:
      - prometheus.demo.do.prometheus.io:9090
```

This `ConfigMap` will then need to be mounted in the `Prometheus` spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: your-prometheus
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
spec:
  scrapeConfigSelector:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
  configMaps:
    - scrape-file-sd-targets
```

You can then use ScrapeConfig to reference that file and scrape the associated targets:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: file-sd
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
    app.kubernetes.io/name: scrape-config-example
spec:
  fileSDConfigs:
    - files:
        - /etc/prometheus/configmaps/scrape-file-sd-targets/targets.yaml
```

## `http_sd`

`http_sd` works the same way as the `file_sd` but requires an endpoint providing that data rather than a file. For instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: http-sd
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    prometheus: system-monitoring-prometheus
    app.kubernetes.io/name: scrape-config-example
spec:
  httpSDConfigs:
    - url: http://my-external-api/discovery
      refreshInterval: 15s
```
