# Cluster Monitoring

This guide is intended to give an introduction to all the parts required to start monitoring a Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of how to use the functionality the Prometheus Operator implements. If you haven't yet, we recommend reading through the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) as well as the [alerting guide](alerting.md).

## Metric Sources

Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus is a natural choice as Kubernetes components themselves are instrumented with Prometheus metrics, therefore those components simply have to be discovered by Prometheus and most of the cluster is monitored.

Metrics that are rather about cluster state than a single component's metrics is exposed by the add-on component [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics).

Additionally, to have an overview of cluster nodes' resources the Prometheus [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is used. The node_exporter allows monitoring a node's resources: CPU, memory and disk utilization and more.

Once you complete this guide you will monitor the following:

* cluster state via kube-state-metrics
* nodes via the node_exporter
* kubelets
* apiserver
* kube-scheduler
* kube-controller-manager

## Preparing Kubernetes Components

The manifests used here use the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator), which manages Prometheus servers and their configuration in a cluster. Prometheus discovers targets through `Endpoints` objects, which means all targets that are running as `Pod`s in the Kubernetes cluster are easily monitored. Many Kubernetes components can be [self-hosted](https://coreos.com/blog/self-hosted-kubernetes.html) today. The kubelet, however, is not. Therefore the Prometheus Operator implements a functionality to synchronize the kubelets into an `Endpoints` object. To make use of that functionality the `--kubelet-service` argument must be passed to the Prometheus Operator when running it.


> We assume that the kubelet uses token authN and authZ, as otherwise Prometheus needs a client certificate, which gives it full access to the kubelet, rather than just the metrics. Token authN and authZ allows more fine grained and easier access control. Simply start minikube with the following command (you can of course adapt the version and memory to your needs):
>
> $ minikube delete && minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.9.1 --memory=4096 --bootstrapper=kubeadm --extra-config=kubelet.authentication-token-webhook=true --extra-config=kubelet.authorization-mode=Webhook --extra-config=scheduler.address=0.0.0.0 --extra-config=controller-manager.address=0.0.0.0
>
> In future versions of minikube and kubeadm this will be the default, but for the time being, we will have to configure it ourselves.

Once started it ensures that all internal IPs of the nodes in the cluster are synchronized into the specified `Endpoints` object. In this case the object is called `kubelet` and is located in the `kube-system` namespace.

By default every Kubernetes cluster has a `Service` for easy access to the API server. This is the `Service` called `kubernetes` in the `default` namespace. A `Service` object automatically synchronizes an `Endpoints` object with the targets it selects. Therefore there is nothing, extra to do for Prometheus to be able to discover the API server.

Aside from the kubelet and the API server the other Kubernetes components all run on top of Kubernetes itself. To discover Kubernetes components that run in a Pod, they simply have to be added to a `Service`.

> Note the `Service` manifests for the scheduler and controller-manager are just examples. They may need to be adapted respective to a cluster.

kube-scheduler:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

## Exporters

Unrelated to Kubernetes itself, but still important is to gather various metrics about the actual nodes. Typical metrics are CPU, memory, disk and network utilization, all of these metrics can be gathered using the node_exporter.

And the respective `Service` manifest:

[embedmd]:# (../../contrib/kube-prometheus/manifests/kube-state-metrics-service.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: v1

    port: 9443

```

## Setup Monitoring

Once all the steps in the previous section have been taken there should be `Endpoints` objects containing the IPs of all of the above mentioned Kubernetes components. Now to setup the actual Prometheus and Alertmanager clusters. This manifest assumes that the Alertmanager cluster will be deployed in the `monitoring` namespace.

[embedmd]:# (../../contrib/kube-prometheus/manifests/prometheus-prometheus.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
  name: k8s
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  alerting:
    alertmanagers:
    - name: alertmanager-main
      namespace: monitoring
      port: web
  baseImage: quay.io/prometheus/prometheus
  nodeSelector:
    beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
  replicas: 2
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 400Mi
  ruleSelector:
    matchLabels:
      prometheus: k8s
      role: alert-rules
  serviceAccountName: prometheus-k8s
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: k8s-app
      operator: Exists
  version: v2.2.1
```

> Make sure that the `ServiceAccount` called `prometheus-k8s` exists and if using RBAC, is bound to the correct role. Read more on [RBAC when using the Prometheus Operator](../rbac.md).

The expression to match for selecting `ServiceMonitor`s here is that they must have a label which has a key called `k8s-app`. If you look closely at all the `Service` objects described above they all have a label called `k8s-app` and their component name this allows to conveniently select them with `ServiceMonitor`s.

  nodeSelector:
    beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
  replicas: 3
  serviceAccountName: alertmanager-main
  version: v0.14.0
```

Read more in the [alerting guide](alerting.md) on how to configure the Alertmanager as it will not spin up unless it has a valid configuration mounted through a `Secret`. Note that the `Secret` has to be in the same namespace as the `Alertmanager` resource as well as have the name `alertmanager-<name-of-alertmanager-object` and the key of the configuration is `alertmanager.yaml`.

## Outlook

Once finished with this guide you have an entire monitoring pipeline for Kubernetes. To now access the web UIs they need to be exposed by the Kubernetes cluster, read through the [exposing Prometheus and Alertmanager guide](exposing-prometheus-and-alertmanager.md) to find out how.

To help get started more quickly with monitoring Kubernetes clusters, [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/tree/master/contrib/kube-prometheus) was created. It is a collection of manifests including dashboards and alerting rules that can easily be deployed. It utilizes the Prometheus Operator and all the manifests demonstrated in this guide.
