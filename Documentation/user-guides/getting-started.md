The Prometheus Operator's goal is to make running Prometheus on top of Kubernetes
as easy as possible, while preserving Kubernetes-native configuration options.

This guide will show you how to deploy the Prometheus operator, set up a
Prometheus instance, and configure metrics collection for a sample application.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Prometheus Operator requires use of Kubernetes v1.16.x and up."/>}}

> Note: [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
> were introduced by CoreOS as a class of software that operates other software,
> putting operational knowledge collected by humans into software.

## Pre-requisites

To follow this guide, you will need a Kubernetes cluster with admin permissions.

## Installing the operator

The first step is to install the operator's Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) as well
as the operator itself with the required RBAC resources.

Run the following commands to install the CRDs and deploy the operator in the `default` namespace:

```bash
LATEST=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/latest | jq -cr .tag_name)
curl -sL https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/download/${LATEST}/bundle.yaml | kubectl create -f -
```

It can take a few minutes for the operator to be up and running. You can check for completion with the following command:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pods -l  app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus-operator -n default
```

The Prometheus Operator introduces custom resources in Kubernetes to declare
the desired state of a Prometheus and Alertmanager cluster as well as the
Prometheus configuration. For this guide, the resources of interest are:

* `Prometheus`
* `ServiceMonitor`
* `PodMonitor`

The `Prometheus` resource declaratively describes the desired state of a
Prometheus deployment, while `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor` resources
describe the targets to be monitored by Prometheus.

## Deploying a sample application

First, let's deploy a simple example application with 3 replicas which listens
and exposes metrics on port `8080`.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/example-app-deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-app
        image: fabxc/instrumented_app
        ports:
        - name: web
          containerPort: 8080
```

Let's expose the application with a Service object which selects all the Pods
with the `app` label having the `example-app` value. The Service object also
specifies the port on which the metrics are exposed.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/example-app-service.yaml"
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: example-app
  labels:
    app: example-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: example-app
  ports:
  - name: web
    port: 8080
```

Finally we create a ServiceMonitor object which selects all Service objects
with the `app: example-app` label. The ServiceMonitor object also has a `team`
label (in this case `team: frontend`) to identify which team is responsible for
monitoring the application/service.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/example-app-service-monitor.yaml"
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: example-app
  labels:
    team: frontend
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  endpoints:
  - port: web
```

## Deploying Prometheus

If
[RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/)
authorization is activated on your cluster, you must first create the RBAC rules
for the Prometheus service account beforehand.

Apply the following manifests to create the service account and required ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding:

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/rbac/prometheus/prometheus-service-account.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: prometheus
```

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/rbac/prometheus/prometheus-cluster-role.yaml"
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: prometheus
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
  - nodes
  - nodes/metrics
  - services
  - endpoints
  - pods
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
  - configmaps
  verbs: ["get"]
- apiGroups:
  - networking.k8s.io
  resources:
  - ingresses
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- nonResourceURLs: ["/metrics"]
  verbs: ["get"]
```

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/rbac/prometheus/prometheus-cluster-role-binding.yaml"
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prometheus
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: prometheus
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: prometheus
  namespace: default
```

For more information, see the [Prometheus Operator RBAC guide]({{< ref "rbac" >}}).

The Prometheus custom resource defines the characteristics of the underlying
concrete StatefulSet (number of replicas, resource requests/limits , ...) as
well as which ServiceMonitors should be included with the
`spec.serviceMonitorSelector` field.

Previously, we have created the ServiceMonitor object with the `team: frontend`
label and here we define that the Prometheus object should select all
ServiceMonitors with the `team: frontend` label. This enables the frontend team
to create new ServiceMonitors and Services without having to reconfigure the
Prometheus object.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/prometheus-service-monitor.yaml"
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      team: frontend
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 400Mi
  enableAdminAPI: false
```

To verify that the instance is up and running, run:

```bash
kubectl get -n default prometheus prometheus -w
```

By default, Prometheus will only pick up ServiceMonitors from the current
namespace. To select ServiceMonitors from other namespaces, you can update the
`spec.serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector` field of the Prometheus resource.

## Using PodMonitors

Instead of a ServiceMonitor, we can use a PodMonitor which doesn't require the
creation of a Kubernetes Service. In practice, the `spec.selector` label tells
Prometheus which Pods should be scraped.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/example-app-pod-monitor.yaml"
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: example-app
  labels:
    team: frontend
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  podMetricsEndpoints:
  - port: web
```

Similarly the Prometheus object defines which PodMonitors get selected with the
`spec.podMonitorSelector` field.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/prometheus-pod-monitor.yaml"
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  podMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      team: frontend
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 400Mi
  enableAdminAPI: false
```

## Exposing the Prometheus service

To access the Prometheus interface, you have to expose the service to the outside. For
simplicity, we use a `NodePort` Service.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/prometheus-service.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - name: web
    nodePort: 30900
    port: 9090
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: web
  selector:
    prometheus: prometheus
```

Once the Service is created, the Prometheus web server is available under the
node's IP address on port `30900`. The Targets page in the web interface should
show that the instances of the example application have successfully been
discovered.

> Note: Exposing the Prometheus web server this way may not be an applicable solution. Read more about the possible options in the [Ingress guide](exposing-prometheus-and-alertmanager.md).

## Exposing the Prometheus Admin API

Prometheus Admin API allows access to delete series for a certain time range,
cleanup tombstones, capture snapshots, etc. More information about the admin
API can be found in [Prometheus official
documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-admin-apis)
This API access is disabled by default and can be toggled using this boolean
flag. The following example exposes the admin API:

> WARNING: Enabling the admin APIs enables mutating endpoints, to delete data,
> shutdown Prometheus, and more. Enabling this should be done with care and the
> user is advised to add additional authentication/authorization via a proxy to
> ensure only clients authorized to perform these actions can do so.

```yaml mdox-exec="cat example/user-guides/getting-started/prometheus-admin-api.yaml"
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  serviceAccountName: prometheus
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      team: frontend
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 400Mi
  enableAdminAPI: true
```
