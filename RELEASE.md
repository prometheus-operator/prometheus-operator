# Release schedule

Following [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/RELEASE.md) and [Thanos](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/master/docs/release-process.md), this project aims for a predictable release schedule.

Release cadence of first pre-releases being cut is 6 weeks.

# How to cut a new release

> This guide is strongly based on the [Prometheus release instructions](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/RELEASE.md).

## Branch management and versioning strategy

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

We maintain a separate branch for each minor release, named `release-<major>.<minor>`, e.g. `release-1.1`, `release-2.0`.

The usual flow is to merge new features and changes into the master branch and to merge bug fixes into the latest release branch. Bug fixes are then merged into master from the latest release branch. The master branch should always contain all commits from the latest release branch.

If a bug fix got accidentally merged into master, cherry-pick commits have to be created in the latest release branch, which then have to be merged back into master. Try to avoid that situation.

Maintaining the release branches for older minor releases happens on a best effort basis.

## Update Go dependencies

A couple of days before the release, consider submitting a PR against the `master` branch to update the Go dependencies.

```bash
make update-go-deps
```

## Update operand versions

A couple of days before the release, update the [default versions](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/f6ce472ecd6064fb6769e306b55b149dfb6af903/pkg/operator/defaults.go#L20-L31) of Prometheus, Alertmanager and Thanos if newer versions are available.

## Prepare your release

For a new major or minor release, work from the `master` branch. For a patch release, work in the branch of the minor release you want to patch (e.g. `release-0.43` if you're releasing `v0.43.2`).

Bump the version in the `VERSION` file in the root of the repository.

A number of files have to be re-generated, this is automated with the following make target:

```bash
make clean generate
```

Bump the version of the `pkg/apis/monitoring` and `pkg/client` packages in `go.mod`:

```bash
go mod edit -require "github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/apis/monitoring@v$(< VERSION)"
go mod edit -require "github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/client@v$(< VERSION)"
```

Now that all version information has been updated, an entry for the new version can be added to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

Entries in the `CHANGELOG.md` are meant to be in this order:

* `[CHANGE]`
* `[FEATURE]`
* `[ENHANCEMENT]`
* `[BUGFIX]`

Create a PR for the changes to be reviewed.

## Publish the new release

For new minor and major releases, create the `release-<major>.<minor>` branch starting at the PR merge commit.

From now on, all work happens on the `release-<major>.<minor>` branch.

Tag the new release with a tag named `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, e.g. `v2.1.3`. Note the `v` prefix. Tag also the `github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/apis/monitoring` module with `pkg/apis/monitoring/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and the `github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/client` module with `pkg/client/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. You can do the tagging on the commandline:

```bash
tag="v$(< VERSION)"
git tag -s "${tag}" -m "${tag}"
git tag -s "pkg/apis/monitoring/${tag}" -m "pkg/apis/monitoring/${tag}"
git tag -s "pkg/client/${tag}" -m "pkg/client/${tag}"
git push origin "${tag}" "pkg/apis/monitoring/${tag}" "pkg/client/${tag}"
```

Signed tag with a GPG key is appreciated, but in case you can't add a GPG key to your Github account using the following [procedure](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-gpg-key/), you can replace the `-s` flag by `-a` flag of the `git tag` command to only annotate the tag without signing.

Our CI pipeline will automatically push the container images to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/prometheus-operator).

Go to  https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/new, associate the new release with the before pushed tag, paste in changes made to `CHANGELOG.md` and click "Publish release".

For patch releases, submit a pull request to merge back the release branch into the `master` branch.

## Update kube-prometheus

Bump the versions of `github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator` in [prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) (see this [pull request](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/pull/674) for example).

Take a breath. You're done releasing.
