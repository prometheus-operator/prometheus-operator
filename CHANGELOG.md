## 0.57.0 / 2022-06-02

The main change introduced by this release is a new v1beta1 API version for the
AlertmanagerConfig CRD.

Changes compared to the v1alpha1 API:
* Renamed `spec.muteTimeIntervals` field to `to spec.timeIntervals`.
* Removed `regex` field from the `Matcher` type.
* Replaced all `v1.SecretKeySelector` types by the `SecretKeySelector` type
  * Removed `optional` field.
  * `name` and `key` fields are required.

As a pre-requisite, you need to deploy the admission webhook and configure the
conversion webhook in the AlertmanagerConfig CRD object so that users can use
both v1alpha1 and v1beta1 versions at the same time. There are more details in
`Documentation/user-guides/webhook.md` about the webhook configuration.

Because of the conversion webhook requirement, the new version is an opt-in
feature: the `bundle.yaml` file and the manifests from
`example/prometheus-operator-crd` don't deploy the new API version (the
manifests to enable the v1beta1 version are under the
`example/prometheus-operator-crd-full` directory). We will wait until v0.59.0
(at least) before enabling the new API version by default.

* [CHANGE] Added validations at the API level for the time-based fields of the ThanosRuler CRD. #4815
* [CHANGE] Added validations at the API level for the OpsGenie's `responders` field of the AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4725
* [FEATURE] Added v1beta1 version for AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4709
* [FEATURE] Added support for Telegram receiver in the AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4726
* [FEATURE] Added `updateAlerts` field to the OpsGenie configuration of the AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4726
* [FEATURE] Added `hostAliases` field to the the Alertmanager, Prometheus and ThanosRuler CRDs. #4787
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added configuration option in the jsonnet mixins to specify the aggregation labels. #4814
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `attachMetadata` field to the PodMonitor CRD. #4792
* [BUGFIX] Fixed the curl command for exec probes when `listenLocal` is set to true in the Prometheus object. It avoids temporary service outage due to long WAL replays. #4804

## 0.43.0 / 2020-10-26

This release introduces a new `AlertmanagerConfig` CRD that allows to split the
Alertmanager configuration in different objects. For now the CRD only supports
the PagerDuty, OpsGenie and webhook receivers, [other
integrations](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22receiver+type%22)
will follow in future releases of the operator. The current version of the CRD
is `v1alpha1` meaning that testing/feedback is encouraged and welcome but the
feature is not yet considered stable and the API is subject to change in the
future.

* [CHANGE] Use a single reloader sidecar (instead of 2) for Prometheus. The `--config-reloader-image` flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future release (not before v0.45.0). *Make sure to start the operator with a version of `--prometheus-config-reloader` that is at least `v0.43.0` otherwise the Prometheus pods will fail to start.* #3457

## 0.24.0 / 2018-10-11

This release has a breaking changes for `prometheus_operator_.*` metrics.

`prometheus_operator_alertmanager_reconcile_errors_total` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_reconcile_errors_total`
are now combined and called `prometheus_operator_reconcile_errors_total`.
Instead the metric has a "controller" label which indicates the errors from the Prometheus or Alertmanager controller.

The same happened with `prometheus_operator_alertmanager_spec_replicas` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_spec_replicas`
which is now called `prometheus_operator_spec_replicas` and also has the "controller" label.

The `prometheus_operator_triggered_total` metric now has a "controller" label as well and finally instruments the
Alertmanager controller.

For a full description see: https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/pull/1984#issue-221139702

In order to support multiple namespaces, the `--namespace` flag changed to `--namespaces`
and accepts and comma-separated list of namespaces as a string.

## 0.20.0 / 2018-06-05

With this release we introduce a new Custom Resource Definition - the
`PrometheusRule` CRD. It addresses the need for rule syntax validation and rule
selection across namespaces. `PrometheusRule` replaces the configuration of
Prometheus rules via K8s ConfigMaps. There are two migration paths:

1. Automated live migration: If the Prometheus Operator finds Kubernetes
   ConfigMaps that match the `RuleSelector` in a `Prometheus` specification, it
   will convert them to matching `PrometheusRule` resources.

2. Manual migration: We provide a basic CLI tool to convert Kubernetes
   ConfigMaps to `PrometheusRule` resources.

```bash
go get -u github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/cmd/po-rule-migration
po-rule-migration \
--rule-config-map=<path-to-config-map> \
--rule-crds-destination=<path-to-rule-crd-destination>
```

* [FEATURE] Add leveled logging to Prometheus Operator (#1277)
* [FEATURE] Allow additional Alertmanager configuration in Prometheus CRD (#1338)
* [FEATURE] Introduce `PrometheusRule` Custom Resource Definition (#1333)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow Prometheus to consider all namespaces to find ServiceMonitors (#1278)
* [BUGFIX] Do not attempt to set default memory request for Prometheus 2.0 (#1275)

* [BUGFIX] Allow up to 10m for Prometheus pod on startup for data recovery (#1232)

## 0.18.1 / 2018-04-09

* [BUGFIX] Fix alertmanager >=0.15.0 cluster gossip communication (#1193)

## 0.18.0 / 2018-03-04

From this release onwards only Kubernetes versions v1.8 and higher are supported. If you have an older version of Kubernetes and the Prometheus Operator running, we recommend upgrading Kubernetes first and then the Prometheus Operator.

While multiple validation issues have been fixed, it will remain a beta feature in this release. If you want to update validations, you need to either apply the CustomResourceDefinitions located in `example/prometheus-operator-crd` or delete all CRDs and restart the Prometheus Operator.

Some changes cause Prometheus and Alertmanager clusters to be redeployed. If you do not have persistent storage backing your data, this means you will loose the amount of data equal to your retention time.

* [CHANGE] Use canonical `/prometheus` and `/alertmanager` as data dirs in containers.
* [FEATURE] Allow configuring Prometheus and Alertmanager servers to listen on loopback interface, allowing proxies to be the ingress point of those Pods.
* [FEATURE] Allow configuring additional containers in Prometheus and Alertmanager Pods.
* [FEATURE] Add ability to whitelist Kubernetes labels to become Prometheus labels.
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying additional secrets for Alertmanager Pods to mount.
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying `bearer_token_file` for Alertmanger configurations of Prometheus objects in order to authenticate with Alertmanager.
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying TLS configuration for Alertmanger configurations of Prometheus objects.
* [FEATURE] Add metrics for reconciliation errors: `prometheus_operator_alertmanager_reconcile_errors_total` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_reconcile_errors_total`.
* [FEATURE] Support `read_recent` and `required_matchers` fields for remote read configurations.
* [FEATURE] Allow disabling any defaults of `SecurityContext` fields of Pods.
* [BUGFIX] Handle Alertmanager >=v0.15.0 breaking changes correctly.
* [BUGFIX] Fix invalid validations for metric relabeling fields.
* [BUGFIX] Fix validations for `AlertingSpec`.
* [BUGFIX] Fix validations for deprecated storage fields.
* [BUGFIX] Fix remote read and write basic auth support.
* [BUGFIX] Fix properly propagate errors of Prometheus config reloader.

## 0.17.0 / 2018-02-15

This release adds validations as a beta feature. It will only be installed on new clusters, existing CRD definitions will not be updated, this will be done in a future release. Please try out this feature and give us feedback!

* [CHANGE] Default Prometheus version v2.2.0-rc.0.
* [CHANGE] Default Alertmanager version v0.14.0.
* [FEATURE] Generate and add CRD validations.

## 0.13.0 / 2017-09-21

After a long period of not having broken any functionality in the Prometheus Operator, we have decided to promote the status of this project to beta.

Compatibility guarantees and migration strategies continue to be the same as for the `v0.12.0` release.

* [CHANGE] Remove analytics collection.
* [BUGFIX] Fix memory leak in kubelet endpoints sync.
* [FEATURE] Allow setting global default `scrape_interval`.
* [FEATURE] Allow setting Pod objectmeta to Prometheus and Alertmanger objects.
* [FEATURE] Allow setting tolerations and affinity for Prometheus and Alertmanager objects.

## 0.12.0 / 2017-08-24

Starting with this release only Kubernetes `v1.7.x` and up is supported as CustomResourceDefinitions are a requirement for the Prometheus Operator and are only available from those versions and up.

Additionally all objects have been promoted from `v1alpha1` to `v1`. On start up of this version of the Prometheus Operator the previously used `ThirdPartyResource`s and the associated `v1alpha1` objects will be automatically migrated to their `v1` equivalent `CustomResourceDefinition`.

* [CHANGE] All manifests created and used by the Prometheus Operator have been promoted from `v1alpha1` to `v1`.
* [CHANGE] Use Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`s instead of `ThirdPartyResource`s.
* [FEATURE] Add ability to set scrape timeout to `ServiceMonitor`.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Use `StatefulSet` rolling deployments.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Properly set `SecurityContext` for Prometheus 2.0 deployments.

Warning: This release deprecates the previously used storage definition in favor of upstream PersistentVolumeClaim templates. While this should not have an immediate effect on a running cluster, Prometheus object definitions that have storage configured need to be adapted. The previously existing fields are still there, but have no effect anymore.

* [FEATURE] Add Prometheus 2.0 alpha3 support.
* [FEATURE] Use PVC templates instead of custom storage definition.
* [FEATURE] Add cAdvisor port to kubelet sync.
* [FEATURE] Allow default base images to be configurable.
* [FEATURE] Configure Prometheus to only use necessary namespaces.

## 0.10.1 / 2017-06-13

Attention: if the basic auth feature was previously used, the `key` and `name`
fields need to be switched. This was not intentional, and the bug is not fixed,
but causes this change.

* [CHANGE] Prometheus default version v1.7.1.
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager default version v0.7.1.
* [BUGFIX] Fix basic auth secret key selector `key` and `name` switched.
* [BUGFIX] Fix route prefix flag not always being set for Prometheus.
