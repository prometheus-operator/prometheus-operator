## 0.43.0 / 2020-10-26

This release introduces a new `AlertmanagerConfig` CRD that allows to split the
Alertmanager configuration in different objects. For now the CRD only supports
the PagerDuty, OpsGenie and webhook receivers, [other
integrations](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22receiver+type%22)
will follow in future releases of the operator. The current version of the CRD
is `v1alpha1` meaning that testing/feedback is encouraged and welcome but the
feature is not yet considered stable and the API is subject to change in the
future.

* [CHANGE] Use a single reloader sidecar (instead of 2) for Prometheus. The `--config-reloader-image` flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future release (not before v0.45.0). *Make sure to start the operator with a version of `--prometheus-config-reloader` that is at least `v0.43.0` otherwise the Prometheus pods will fail to start.* #3457

## 0.24.0 / 2018-10-11

This release has a breaking changes for `prometheus_operator_.*` metrics.

`prometheus_operator_alertmanager_reconcile_errors_total` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_reconcile_errors_total`
are now combined and called `prometheus_operator_reconcile_errors_total`.
Instead the metric has a "controller" label which indicates the errors from the Prometheus or Alertmanager controller.

The same happened with `prometheus_operator_alertmanager_spec_replicas` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_spec_replicas`
which is now called `prometheus_operator_spec_replicas` and also has the "controller" label.

The `prometheus_operator_triggered_total` metric now has a "controller" label as well and finally instruments the
Alertmanager controller.

For a full description see: https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/pull/1984#issue-221139702

In order to support multiple namespaces, the `--namespace` flag changed to `--namespaces`
and accepts and comma-separated list of namespaces as a string.

* [FEATURE] Add Thanos integration (experimental).
* [BUGFIX] Fix usage of console templates and libraries.

## 0.20.0 / 2018-06-05

With this release we introduce a new Custom Resource Definition - the
`PrometheusRule` CRD. It addresses the need for rule syntax validation and rule
selection across namespaces. `PrometheusRule` replaces the configuration of
Prometheus rules via K8s ConfigMaps. There are two migration paths:

1. Automated live migration: If the Prometheus Operator finds Kubernetes
   ConfigMaps that match the `RuleSelector` in a `Prometheus` specification, it
   will convert them to matching `PrometheusRule` resources.

2. Manual migration: We provide a basic CLI tool to convert Kubernetes
   ConfigMaps to `PrometheusRule` resources.

```bash
go get -u github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/cmd/po-rule-migration
po-rule-migration \
--rule-config-map=<path-to-config-map> \
--rule-crds-destination=<path-to-rule-crd-destination>
```

## 0.18.0 / 2018-03-04

From this release onwards only Kubernetes versions v1.8 and higher are supported. If you have an older version of Kubernetes and the Prometheus Operator running, we recommend upgrading Kubernetes first and then the Prometheus Operator.

While multiple validation issues have been fixed, it will remain a beta feature in this release. If you want to update validations, you need to either apply the CustomResourceDefinitions located in `example/prometheus-operator-crd` or delete all CRDs and restart the Prometheus Operator.

Some changes cause Prometheus and Alertmanager clusters to be redeployed. If you do not have persistent storage backing your data, this means you will loose the amount of data equal to your retention time.

* [CHANGE] Use canonical `/prometheus` and `/alertmanager` as data dirs in containers.
* [FEATURE] Allow configuring Prometheus and Alertmanager servers to listen on loopback interface, allowing proxies to be the ingress point of those Pods.
* [FEATURE] Allow configuring additional containers in Prometheus and Alertmanager Pods.
* [FEATURE] Add ability to whitelist Kubernetes labels to become Prometheus labels.
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying additional secrets for Alertmanager Pods to mount.
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying `bearer_token_file` for Alertmanger configurations of Prometheus objects in order to authenticate with Alertmanager.
* [FEATURE] Allow specifying TLS configuration for Alertmanger configurations of Prometheus objects.
* [FEATURE] Add metrics for reconciliation errors: `prometheus_operator_alertmanager_reconcile_errors_total` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_reconcile_errors_total`.
* [FEATURE] Support `read_recent` and `required_matchers` fields for remote read configurations.
* [FEATURE] Allow disabling any defaults of `SecurityContext` fields of Pods.
* [BUGFIX] Handle Alertmanager >=v0.15.0 breaking changes correctly.
* [BUGFIX] Fix invalid validations for metric relabeling fields.
* [BUGFIX] Fix validations for `AlertingSpec`.
* [BUGFIX] Fix validations for deprecated storage fields.
* [BUGFIX] Fix remote read and write basic auth support.
* [BUGFIX] Fix properly propagate errors of Prometheus config reloader.

## 0.17.0 / 2018-02-15

## 0.13.0 / 2017-09-21

After a long period of not having broken any functionality in the Prometheus Operator, we have decided to promote the status of this project to beta.

Compatibility guarantees and migration strategies continue to be the same as for the `v0.12.0` release.

* [CHANGE] Remove analytics collection.
* [BUGFIX] Fix memory leak in kubelet endpoints sync.
* [FEATURE] Allow setting global default `scrape_interval`.

* [FEATURE] Allow setting tolerations and affinity for Prometheus and Alertmanager objects.

## 0.12.0 / 2017-08-24

Starting with this release only Kubernetes `v1.7.x` and up is supported as CustomResourceDefinitions are a requirement for the Prometheus Operator and are only available from those versions and up.

Additionally all objects have been promoted from `v1alpha1` to `v1`. On start up of this version of the Prometheus Operator the previously used `ThirdPartyResource`s and the associated `v1alpha1` objects will be automatically migrated to their `v1` equivalent `CustomResourceDefinition`.

Warning: This release deprecates the previously used storage definition in favor of upstream PersistentVolumeClaim templates. While this should not have an immediate effect on a running cluster, Prometheus object definitions that have storage configured need to be adapted. The previously existing fields are still there, but have no effect anymore.

* [FEATURE] Add Prometheus 2.0 alpha3 support.
* [FEATURE] Use PVC templates instead of custom storage definition.
* [FEATURE] Add cAdvisor port to kubelet sync.

fields need to be switched. This was not intentional, and the bug is not fixed,
but causes this change.

* [CHANGE] Prometheus default version v1.7.1.
* [CHANGE] Alertmanager default version v0.7.1.
* [BUGFIX] Fix basic auth secret key selector `key` and `name` switched.

  secrets cannot be modified after creation, if the list if modified after
  creation it will not effect the Prometheus Pods.

## 0.7.0 / 2017-03-17

This release introduces breaking changes to the generated StatefulSet's
PodTemplate, which cannot be modified for StatefulSets. The Prometheus and
Alertmanager objects have to be deleted and recreated for the StatefulSets to
be created properly.

## 0.3.0 / 2017-01-31

This release introduces breaking changes to the underlying naming schemes. It
is recommended to destroy existing Prometheus and Alertmanager objects and
recreate them with new namings.

With this release support for `v1.4.x` clusters is dropped. Changes will not be
backported to the `0.1.x` release series anymore.
