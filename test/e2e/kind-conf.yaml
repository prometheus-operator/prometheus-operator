# We decrease the interval at which kubelet synchronizes the mounted configmaps
# and secrets from the default 1 minute to 10 seconds. It helps speeding up the
# tests because the configuration changes are propagated faster to the
# containers.
#
# While we apply the same settings to all nodes, there's a current limitation
# with Kind that kubelet configuration is cluster-wide so only the first patch
# is applied in fact. See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/3849
# for details.
