                      Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists
                      is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate
                      all taints of a particular category.

                  tolerationSeconds:
                    description: TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the
                      toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this
                      field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not
                      set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict).
                      Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately)
                      by the system.

                      If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise
                      just a regular string.
