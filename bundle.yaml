                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows

                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                        stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach.
                        When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across
                        multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin
                        is opened on container start, is empty until the first client
                        attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data
                        until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed
                        and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
                        flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin
                        will never receive an EOF. Default is false

                  you must mount a volume in the specified directory and it must be

                  root filesystem for security reasons. Alternatively, the location
                  can be set to a stdout location such as `/dev/stdout` to log query

                          to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not
                          be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    dataSource field and as such if both fields are
                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t
                                    specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim

                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                            then the Pod's namespace will be used.  This allows the
                            Kubernetes name scoping to be mirrored within StorageOS
                            for tighter integration. Set VolumeName to any name to
                            override the default behaviour. Set to "default" if you
                            are not using namespaces within StorageOS. Namespaces
                            that do not pre-exist within StorageOS will be created.
