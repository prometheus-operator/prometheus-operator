                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim

                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                              field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                              to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of
                              dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource

                        (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
                        tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but
                        giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce
                        the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an
                        incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment
                        for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
                        with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                        | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is
                        set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
                        zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
                        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                        can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make it *more*

                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                  backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                  in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)
                                  will be set to the same value automatically if one
                                  of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When
                                  namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    is specified, volume binding will only succeed
                                    if the type of the specified object matches some
                                    installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
                                    This field will replace the functionality of the
                                    dataSource field and as such if both fields are
                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t
                                    specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  object. When this field is specified, volume binding

                                  backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                  in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)

                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                        topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread
                        treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation of
                        Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains
                        with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when
                        the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler
                        won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If
                        value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal
                        to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value
                        is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule. \n For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains
                        is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as
                        2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global
                        minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with
                        the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed
                        skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the
                        three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field
                        and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate

                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                              object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                              will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                              matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource
                              field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they
                              must have the same value. For backwards compatibility,
                              when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both
                              fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to
                              the same value automatically if one of them is empty
                              and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                              in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the same
                              value and must be empty. There are three important differences
                              between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                              only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
