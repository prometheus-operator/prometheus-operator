          The `PodMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` can scrape metrics from a group of pods.
          Among other things, it allows to specify:
          * The pods to scrape via label selectors.
          * The container ports to scrape.
          * Authentication credentials to use.
          * Target and metric relabeling.

          `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `PodMonitor` objects using label and namespace selectors.

                  For example if `jobLabel` is set to `foo` and the Kubernetes `Pod`
                  object is labeled with `foo: bar`, then Prometheus adds the `job="bar"`
