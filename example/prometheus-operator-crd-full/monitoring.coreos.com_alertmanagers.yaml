          The `Alertmanager` custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster. It allows to specify many options such as the number of replicas, persistent storage and many more.

          For each `Alertmanager` resource, the Operator deploys a `StatefulSet` in the same namespace. When there are two or more configured replicas, the Operator runs the Alertmanager instances in high-availability mode.

          The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which `AlertmanagerConfig` objects should be associated to the deployed Alertmanager instances.

                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                      description: |-
                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.

                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                      description: |-
                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.

                        when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated

                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally

                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.

                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                        to topologies that satisfy it.

                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,

                           tracking are needed,

                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                      properties:
                        volumeClaimTemplate:
                          description: |-
                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                            This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                            to the PVC after it has been created.

                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.
