              AlertmanagerConfigSpec is a specification of the desired behavior of the
              Alertmanager configuration.
              By default, the Alertmanager configuration only applies to alerts for which
              the `namespace` label is equal to the namespace of the AlertmanagerConfig
              resource (see the `.spec.alertmanagerConfigMatcherStrategy` field of the
              Alertmanager CRD).

                      CRD schema doesn't support self-referential types for now (see
                      https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/62872). We have to use
                      an alternative type to circumvent the limitation. The downside is that
                      the Kube API can't validate the data beyond the fact that it is a valid
                      JSON representation.
