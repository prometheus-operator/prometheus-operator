          The `ServiceMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` can scrape metrics from a group of services.
          Among other things, it allows to specify:
          * The services to scrape via label selectors.
          * The container ports to scrape.
          * Authentication credentials to use.
          * Target and metric relabeling.


          `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `ServiceMonitor` objects using label and namespace selectors.
