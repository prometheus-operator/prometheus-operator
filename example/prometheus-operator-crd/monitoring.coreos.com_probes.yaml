          The `Probe` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how to scrape metrics from prober exporters such as the [blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).

          The `Probe` resource needs 2 pieces of information:
          * The list of probed addresses which can be defined statically or by discovering Kubernetes Ingress objects.
          * The prober which exposes the availability of probed endpoints (over various protocols such HTTP, TCP, ICMP, ...) as Prometheus metrics.

          `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `Probe` objects using label and namespace selectors.
