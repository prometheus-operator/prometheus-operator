                  are logged. If the filename has an empty path, e.g. 'query.log',

                  at `/var/log/prometheus`. If a full path is provided, e.g. /var/log/prometheus/query.log,
                  you must mount a volume in the specified directory and it must be
                  writable. This is because the prometheus container runs with a read-only
                  root filesystem for security reasons. Alternatively, the location
                  can be set to a stdout location such as `/dev/stdout` to log query
                  information to the default Prometheus log stream. This is only available
                  in versions of Prometheus >= 2.16.0. For more details, see the Prometheus

                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the

                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well
                                    as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource
                                    ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if
                                    a disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using
